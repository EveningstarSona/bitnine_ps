I would like to present how the algorithms have to be run:

Regarding question 5:
    With an open terminal at this folder, do the following (npm install may take a while):
        cd ./5_1__5_2/bitnine/
        npm install
        npm run dev
    When it starts running, press 'o' so it opens in your browser.

Regarding question 6:
    Firstly, you should open index.html.
    It was integrated with all three algorithms so it can be easily tested.
    If you want to see the algorithms themselves, please refer to their files: 6_1.js, 6_2.js and 6_3.js.
